# Printloop - 3D Printing Automation
When a job completes, the system ejects the finished part, resets the build surface, and immediately starts the next print in the queue - no human intervention, 24/7.

When a job finishes, Printloop ejects the part, and immediately starts the next print in the queue—no human intervention, 24 / 7.

This project is a web app: upload a ready-to-print G-code file and receive G-code augmented with all commands needed for continuous printing.

### Key features:
- Template editor – In the UI, users can view and edit the template that injects loop commands (wait, eject, restart).
